# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This folder tracks durable architecture decisions for the local modern data platform.

## Purpose

This section defines the purpose of this document.
Provide a durable decision log for architecture and operational design choices.

## Commands

This section defines the primary commands for this document.
No runtime commands are executed directly from this index; use linked ADR files and the runbook command sets.

## Validation

This section defines the primary validation approach for this document.
Validate ADR relevance by ensuring referenced workflows and commands remain accurate in README and runbook.

## Troubleshooting

This section defines the primary troubleshooting approach for this document.
When behavior and documentation diverge, review related ADRs first to determine intended design constraints.

## References

This section defines the primary cross-references for this document.

- [../runbook.md](../runbook.md)
- [../../README.md](../../README.md)

Status values:

- Proposed: under discussion, not yet adopted
