# ADR-0004: CDC-Based MDM Enrichment Flow

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-04-18

## Purpose

This section defines the purpose of this document.
Record the decision to use CDC-based MDM enrichment for master data propagation across streaming and analytics layers.

## Commands

This section defines the primary commands for this document.
Primary commands related to this decision:

- `make mdm-topics-check`
- `make mdm-topics-check-dev`

## Validation

This section defines the primary validation approach for this document.
Validate this decision by confirming records flow through curated MDM topics and into landing tables used by downstream models.

## Troubleshooting

This section defines the primary troubleshooting approach for this document.
If MDM topics or landing tables are empty, troubleshoot connector health and sync services before changing dbt logic.

## Context

Customer and product master data changes must be propagated consistently into streaming and analytics layers with low lag and clear lineage.

## Decision

Implement MDM enrichment through a CDC-driven flow:

1. MySQL MDM stores source-of-truth master data.
2. Debezium captures row-level changes.
3. CDC events are republished into curated topics (`mdm_customer`, `mdm_product`).
4. `mdm-pyspark-sync` mirrors MDM tables into Postgres landing tables for downstream dbt models.

## Consequences

- Positive:
  - Near-realtime master data propagation
  - Clear separation between source CDC events and curated domain topics
  - Better downstream consistency for dbt dimensions and facts
- Trade-offs:
  - More moving parts and connector operational dependencies
  - Requires connector/topic health checks in routine operations

## Alternatives considered

- Batch-only master data sync: rejected due to slower freshness and weaker event lineage
- Direct table polling without CDC: rejected due to higher load and less robust change capture semantics
